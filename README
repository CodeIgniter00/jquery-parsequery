This is a low-level jQuery plugin that allows you to parse the query strings
commonly used in URLs.

It is designed to provide a solid base, on which fancier parsers can be easily
implemented, but should also work out-of-the-box.

For detailed documentation, please see the comments in jquery.parsequery.js;
the impatient may just call $.parseQuery() and use the result.

This originated from mkmanning's original jQuery.parseQuery plugin, though very
little of the original remains; it is still released under the MIT license.

Comments, bug reports and feature requests are always welcome.
